CORD-19 Data Explorer
This project analyzes the CORD-19 dataset to explore patterns in COVID-19 research papers and presents the findings through an interactive Streamlit application.
Overview
The project involves:

Loading and cleaning the CORD-19 metadata.csv file.
Performing basic data analysis (e.g., publication trends, top journals, word frequencies).
Creating visualizations (bar charts, word cloud).
Building a Streamlit app for interactive exploration.

Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/OgayoTK1/Frameworks_Assignment.git
cd Frameworks_Assignment


Install Dependencies:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn streamlit wordcloud


Download the Dataset:

Download metadata.csv from Kaggle.
Place it in the project directory.


Run the Analysis:
python analysis.py

This generates a cleaned dataset (cleaned_metadata.csv) and visualization files.

Run the Streamlit App:
streamlit run app.py

Open the provided URL in your browser to view the app.


Files

analysis.py: Script for data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
app.py: Streamlit application for interactive exploration.
cleaned_metadata.csv: Cleaned dataset (generated by analysis.py).
Visualization files: publications_by_year.png, top_journals.png, title_wordcloud.png, source_counts.png.

Findings

Publication Trends: Most papers were published in 2020â€“2021, peaking during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Top Journals: Journals like The Lancet and Nature published significant COVID-19 research.
Common Words: Titles frequently include terms like "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2", and "pandemic".
Sources: PubMed and Elsevier are major sources of papers.

Challenges and Learning

Challenges:
Handling missing data in abstracts and publication dates.
Managing large dataset size (used low_memory=False and considered sampling).
Learning Streamlit for interactive visualization.


Learning:
Gained experience with pandas for data cleaning and analysis.
Learned to create visualizations with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and WordCloud.
Built a basic Streamlit app for data presentation.



Requirements

Python 3.7+
Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, streamlit, wordcloud
Dataset: CORD-19 metadata.csv

Notes

If the dataset is too large, consider loading a subset using pd.read_csv('metadata.csv', nrows=10000).
Ensure visualizations are saved before running the Streamlit app.
